# Supervised-Learning

## Objective:
The classification goal is to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans.

## Steps and tasks:
1. Read the column description and ensure you understand each attribute well
2. Study the data distribution in each attribute, share your findings
3. Get the target column distribution. Your comments
4. Split the data into training and test set in the ratio of 70:30 respectively
5. Use different classification models (Logistic, K-NN and Na√Øve Bayes) to predict the likelihood of a liability customer buying personal loans
6. Print the confusion matrix for all the above models
7. Give your reasoning on which is the best model in this case and why it performs better?
